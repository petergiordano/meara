# Project Constitution

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-13  
**Status:** Active

---

## Preamble

This constitution establishes the immutable principles that govern all development within this project. These principles ensure consistency, quality, and maintainability across all features, regardless of which AI agent or developer implements them.

The constitution is inspired by spec-driven development methodologies and reflects our commitment to building **Simple, Lovable, Complete** products.

## Article I: Library-First Principle

**Every feature in this project MUST begin its existence as a standalone library.**

### Section 1.1: Mandatory Library Structure
No feature shall be implemented directly within application code without first being abstracted into a reusable library component.

### Section 1.2: Library Characteristics
Each library must:
- Have a clear, single responsibility
- Expose a well-defined public API
- Include comprehensive documentation
- Be testable in isolation
- Have minimal external dependencies

### Section 1.3: Exception Process
Exceptions to library-first implementation require:
- Documented justification explaining why library abstraction is inappropriate
- Review and approval by technical lead
- Explicit tracking in the "Complexity Tracking" section of implementation plans

**Rationale:** Library-first design enforces modularity, reusability, and clear boundaries. It prevents monolithic codebases and makes testing significantly easier.

---

## Article II: CLI Interface Mandate

**Every library MUST expose its functionality through a command-line interface.**

### Section 2.1: Text-Based Interface Requirements
All CLI interfaces MUST:
- Accept text as input (via stdin, arguments, or files)
- Produce text as output (via stdout)
- Support JSON format for structured data exchange
- Return appropriate exit codes (0 for success, non-zero for errors)

### Section 2.2: Observability Requirement
CLI interfaces make functionality:
- Observable through terminal inspection
- Testable through shell scripts
- Debuggable through direct invocation
- Scriptable for automation

### Section 2.3: Exception Cases
GUI-only features (where CLI makes no sense) must:
- Document why CLI is inappropriate
- Still provide a programmatic API
- Include thorough automated tests

**Rationale:** CLI interfaces enforce transparency, testability, and integration capabilities. They prevent opaque black boxes and enable powerful debugging workflows.

---

## Article III: Test-First Imperative

**This is NON-NEGOTIABLE: All implementation MUST follow strict Test-Driven Development.**

### Section 3.1: The Sacred Order
No implementation code shall be written before:
1. Unit tests are written
2. Tests are validated and approved by the user
3. Tests are confirmed to FAIL (Red phase)

### Section 3.2: TDD Cycle
The development cycle MUST follow:
1. **Red:** Write a failing test that defines desired behavior
2. **Green:** Write minimal code to make the test pass
3. **Refactor:** Improve code quality while keeping tests green

### Section 3.3: Test Review Process
Before implementation begins:
- Present test scenarios to user for validation
- Confirm tests accurately capture requirements
- Ensure tests fail for the right reasons
- User explicitly approves test approach

### Section 3.4: Coverage Requirements
- **Unit tests:** 80% minimum code coverage
- **Critical business logic:** 100% coverage
- **Integration tests:** All critical paths
- **E2E tests:** All primary user journeys

**Rationale:** Test-first development catches bugs early, documents intent, and ensures code does what it's supposed to do. User validation prevents building the wrong thing correctly.

---

## Article IV: Documentation as Code

**Documentation is not an afterthoughtâ€”it's part of the implementation.**

### Section 4.1: Living Documentation
Documentation must:
- Live alongside the code it describes
- Update automatically from code where possible
- Be reviewed with the same rigor as code
- Be versioned with the code

### Section 4.2: Required Documentation
Every feature must include:
- **README:** Purpose, usage, examples
- **API Documentation:** All public interfaces
- **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs):** Key decisions and rationale
- **Examples:** Working code samples
- **Troubleshooting:** Common issues and solutions

### Section 4.3: Documentation Testing
Documentation must be:
- Validated for accuracy through automated checks
- Tested through actual usage examples
- Reviewed for clarity by someone unfamiliar with the code

**Rationale:** Code without documentation is technical debt. Documentation that's separate from code becomes outdated. Living, tested documentation provides true value.

---

## Article V: Semantic Versioning Discipline

**All libraries and APIs MUST follow strict semantic versioning.**

### Section 5.1: Version Format
Version numbers take the form MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH:
- **MAJOR:** Incompatible API changes
- **MINOR:** Backward-compatible new functionality
- **PATCH:** Backward-compatible bug fixes

### Section 5.2: Breaking Changes
Breaking changes (MAJOR version bumps) require:
- Deprecation warnings in prior MINOR version
- Migration guide for users
- Automated migration tools where possible
- Minimum 30-day deprecation period

### Section 5.3: Changelog Maintenance
Every release must include:
- Date of release
- Version number
- List of changes (Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security)
- Links to relevant issues/PRs

**Rationale:** Semantic versioning provides clear expectations about compatibility. Proper versioning enables safe upgrades and prevents surprise breakages.

---

## Article VI: Configuration Over Code

**Behavior should be configurable without code changes.**

### Section 6.1: Environment-Based Configuration
Runtime behavior must be controlled through:
- Environment variables for deployment-specific settings
- Configuration files for complex settings
- Feature flags for gradual rollouts
- Never hardcoded values for environment-specific data

### Section 6.2: Configuration Validation
All configuration must:
- Have sensible defaults
- Validate on application startup
- Fail fast with clear error messages if invalid
- Document all available options

### Section 6.3: Secret Management
Sensitive configuration (API keys, passwords) must:
- Never be committed to version control
- Use environment variables or secret management systems
- Be encrypted at rest
- Have rotation procedures

**Rationale:** Configuration over code enables deployment flexibility, reduces code changes for environmental differences, and improves security.

---

## Article VII: Simplicity Gate

**Complexity must be justified. Simple solutions are preferred.**

### Section 7.1: Simplicity Principles
- Start with the simplest solution that could work
- Add complexity only when proven necessary
- Remove complexity whenever possible
- Question every abstraction

### Section 7.2: Complexity Justification
Any complexity beyond simple, direct solutions requires:
- Documented rationale in ADR (Architecture Decision Record)
- Evidence of the problem it solves
- Measurement of the improvement it provides
- Regular review to determine if still needed

### Section 7.3: Minimal Project Structure
- **Maximum 3 projects for initial implementation**
- Additional projects require documented justification
- Prefer monorepo over multi-repo for related code
- Avoid premature modularization

### Section 7.4: No Future-Proofing
- Build for today's requirements, not tomorrow's guesses
- Refactor when requirements actually change
- Trust that good architecture enables future change
- Avoid speculative features

**Rationale:** Complexity is the enemy of maintainability. Simple systems are easier to understand, modify, and debug. The best code is code that doesn't exist.

---

## Article VIII: Anti-Abstraction Principle

**Use frameworks directly. Avoid unnecessary abstraction layers.**

### Section 8.1: Framework Trust
- Use framework features directly rather than wrapping them
- Learn the framework's patterns and follow them
- Resist the urge to create "better" abstractions
- Wrapper layers allowed only for cross-cutting concerns

### Section 8.2: Data Model Consistency
- **Single source of truth:** One model representation per entity
- Transform at boundaries, not throughout the system
- Database models, API DTOs, and UI types can differ at boundaries
- But within a layer, use one consistent representation

### Section 8.3: Acceptable Abstractions
Abstractions are acceptable for:
- Cross-cutting concerns (logging, error handling, authentication)
- Hiding unstable external dependencies
- Framework-agnostic business logic
- Proven, reusable patterns

### Section 8.4: Abstraction Review
Before creating an abstraction, ask:
1. Does this solve a concrete problem we have today?
2. Have we hit this problem at least 3 times?
3. Is the abstraction simpler than duplicating the code?
4. Can we delete it easily if requirements change?

**Rationale:** Abstractions have costs: cognitive overhead, indirection, maintenance burden. Use frameworks as designed. Most custom abstractions solve problems you don't have yet.

---

## Article IX: Integration-First Testing

**Prefer real implementations over mocks. Test with actual dependencies.**

### Section 9.1: Testing Philosophy
Tests MUST use realistic environments:
- Prefer real databases over mocks (use test database)
- Use actual service instances over stubs
- Test with real network calls where practical
- Mock only external services you don't control

### Section 9.2: Test Database Strategy
- Each test suite uses a dedicated test database
- Tests clean up after themselves
- Use transactions that rollback for isolation
- Schema matches production exactly

### Section 9.3: Contract Testing
- **Contract tests mandatory before implementation**
- Define API contracts first
- Validate contracts from both sides (provider and consumer)
- Contracts serve as executable documentation

### Section 9.4: Test Environment Parity
Development, test, and production environments must be:
- As similar as possible in configuration
- Use the same database engine (not SQLite for test, Postgres for prod)
- Same versions of dependencies
- Same infrastructure services (Redis, message queues, etc.)

### Section 9.5: When Mocks Are Acceptable
Mocks/stubs allowed for:
- Third-party APIs with rate limits or costs
- Services you don't control
- Slow operations in unit tests (but integration tests use real)
- Testing error conditions that are hard to reproduce

**Rationale:** Integration tests catch more bugs than unit tests. Mocks can pass while real integrations fail. Testing with real dependencies gives confidence. Contracts prevent integration surprises.

## Article X: Performance is a Feature

**Performance requirements must be defined and measured from the start.**

### Section 10.1: Performance Budgets
Every feature must define:
- Maximum acceptable page load time
- API response time targets
- Database query time limits
- Memory usage constraints
- Bundle size limits (for frontend)

### Section 10.2: Measurement Requirements
- Performance must be measured in CI/CD pipeline
- Performance regressions fail the build
- Production performance monitored continuously
- Alerts on performance degradation

### Section 10.3: Optimization Strategy
1. **Measure first:** Identify bottlenecks with profiling
2. **Focus on impact:** Optimize the 20% causing 80% of problems
3. **Test after:** Ensure optimizations actually help
4. **Don't prematurely optimize:** Wait for evidence

### Section 10.4: Performance Documentation
Document:
- Expected load and scale
- Performance benchmarks
- Known bottlenecks and mitigation strategies
- Optimization decisions and trade-offs

**Rationale:** Performance is a user experience issue. Slow is broken. Define performance requirements early. Measure continuously. Optimize based on data, not guesses.

---

## Article XI: Security is Not Optional

**Security must be considered at every stage, not bolted on later.**

### Section 11.1: Security by Design
Every feature must address:
- Authentication and authorization
- Input validation and sanitization
- Output encoding to prevent XSS
- Protection against common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
- Data encryption (in transit and at rest for sensitive data)

### Section 11.2: Security Review Gates
Before production deployment:
- [ ] Security checklist completed
- [ ] Dependency vulnerability scan passed
- [ ] Penetration testing for high-risk features
- [ ] Security-focused code review

### Section 11.3: Defense in Depth
Security must be layered:
- Client-side validation for UX
- Server-side validation for security
- Database constraints as final safeguard
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention
- Audit logging for sensitive operations

### Section 11.4: Secure Defaults
- Deny by default (whitelist, not blacklist)
- Least privilege access
- Fail securely (errors don't expose sensitive info)
- Secure configurations out of the box

**Rationale:** Security breaches destroy trust. Security is cheaper to build in than retrofit. Every developer is responsible for security.

---

## Article XII: Accessibility is Not Optional

**Applications must be usable by everyone, including people with disabilities.**

### Section 12.1: WCAG Compliance
All user interfaces must meet:
- **WCAG 2.1 AA** as minimum standard
- **WCAG 2.1 AAA** where feasible
- Automated accessibility testing in CI/CD
- Manual testing with screen readers

### Section 12.2: Accessibility Requirements
- [ ] Semantic HTML used throughout
- [ ] All images have descriptive alt text
- [ ] Color contrast ratios meet WCAG standards
- [ ] Keyboard navigation fully supported
- [ ] Screen reader announcements for dynamic content
- [ ] Form inputs have associated labels
- [ ] Error messages are clear and actionable
- [ ] No information conveyed by color alone

### Section 12.3: Testing Strategy
- Automated tools (axe, Lighthouse) in CI/CD
- Manual keyboard testing
- Screen reader testing (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- User testing with people with disabilities

**Rationale:** Accessibility is a legal requirement in many jurisdictions. It's also the right thing to do. Accessible design often improves usability for everyone.
