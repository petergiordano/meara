## üéØ Epic Overview

### Problem Statement
MEARA currently outputs comprehensive 15-30 page markdown reports that are dense, text-heavy, and difficult for executives to quickly digest. Users must read sequentially to find relevant insights, and top priorities are buried in prose. Executives need to understand key recommendations in under 5 minutes, but the current format requires 15+ minutes of careful reading.

### Solution Summary
Create a rich, interactive web-based dashboard that presents MEARA insights with a "executive summary first, details on demand" philosophy. Users will see top 3 recommendations within 30 seconds, then drill down into supporting insights, analysis, and data. The dashboard transforms tables and metrics into visual charts, enables dimension comparison, and provides clear action items with implementation guidance.

### Success Metrics
| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Time to identify top 3 recommendations | < 30 seconds | User testing observation |
| User engagement vs markdown | > 80% prefer dashboard | User survey |
| All critical insights accessible | < 3 clicks | Navigation depth tracking |
| Dashboard completion rate | > 70% view all sections | Analytics tracking |

## üöÄ Quick Start for Developers

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Read [Project Constitution](../../../memory/constitution.md)
- [ ] Review [SLC Framework](../../../docs/SLC-Framework.md)
- [ ] Understand [Spec-Driven Development](../../../docs/spec-driven.md)
- [ ] Complete Phase 1 (Results display + markdown export)

### Getting Started
1. **Read the specs in order:**
   - Start with [DESIGN_SPEC](./DESIGN_SPEC_interactive-dashboard.md) to understand the design sprint approach
   - Review PRD (when created) for detailed requirements
   - Study FUNCTIONAL_SPEC (when created) for feature details
   - Dive into TECHNICAL_SPEC (when created) for implementation

2. **Set up your environment:**
   ```bash
   # Already set up from Phase 1
   cd /Users/petergiordano/Documents/GitHub/meara/deploy/vercel_frontend

   # Create feature branch
   git checkout -b feature/002-interactive-dashboard

   # Install any new dependencies (TBD)
   npm install
   ```

3. **Design Sprint First:**
   - Conduct 5-day design sprint per DESIGN_SPEC
   - Create high-fidelity prototype
   - User test with Scale employees
   - Finalize design direction before coding

## üìä Epic Scope

### In Scope
- **Executive Summary View**: Top 3 recommendations with impact/effort/ROI scores
- **Dimension Explorer**: 9 dimensions with scores, color-coded by health
- **Critical Issues Display**: Highlighted urgent problems
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Click to expand recommendations into rationale + evidence
- **Data Visualizations**: Charts for scores, radar charts for dimension comparison
- **Quick Wins Section**: Fast, high-impact actions
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and tablet

### Out of Scope (Deferred to Future Epics)
- **Mobile App**: Dashboard optimized for phone screens (defer to V2)
- **Collaboration Features**: Comments, annotations, sharing (defer to Analysis Library epic)
- **Comparison View**: Side-by-side analysis of multiple companies (defer to Analysis Library epic)
- **Export to Slides**: Generate Google Slides presentation (defer to future)
- **Real-time Updates**: Live refresh as analysis runs (defer to V2)

### Dependencies
- **Depends on:** EPIC_001 Phase 1 (Results display page) - COMPLETE
- **Blocks:** None (standalone feature)
- **External dependencies:**
  - Backend API must return structured JSON (not just markdown)
  - May need new visualization library (e.g., Recharts, D3.js)

## üé® SLC Framework Application

### Simple
**Core Value Proposition:** Show executives the top 3 things to do in 30 seconds, with one-click access to supporting details.

**Ruthless Prioritization:**
- ‚úÖ Must-have: Top recommendations, dimension scores, critical issues, basic drill-down
- ‚è≥ Nice-to-have: Advanced charts, dimension comparison, animation effects
- ‚ùå Out of scope: Collaboration, exports, mobile optimization

**Intuitive Experience:**
- Visual hierarchy: Color-coded priorities (red = critical, yellow = important, green = good)
- F-pattern layout: Key info at top-left, details below
- One-click expansion: No complex navigation menus

### Lovable
**Delightful Touches:**
- **Smooth animations**: Cards expand/collapse with subtle fade
- **Micro-interactions**: Hover states on recommendations show preview
- **Progress indicators**: Visual progress through dimensions

**Pain Point Solution:**
- Solves "information overload" by starting with just 3 recommendations
- Makes dense reports scannable through visual hierarchy
- Turns tables into beautiful charts

**User Feedback Integration:**
- Design sprint includes user testing with 3-5 Scale employees
- Iterate based on feedback before development

### Complete
**Promise Fulfillment:**
- Fully replaces need to read markdown for executive decisions
- Every insight in markdown is accessible via dashboard
- No functionality lost from markdown version

**No Dead Ends:**
- Every recommendation has "View Evidence" button
- "Back to Summary" button on every drill-down page
- Breadcrumbs show current location

**Quality Standards:**
- Load time: < 2 seconds for dashboard initial render
- Accessibility: WCAG AA compliant
- Responsive: Works on desktop (1920x1080) and tablet (1024x768)

| TBD | Design sprint scheduled | TBD |

### Blockers & Risks
| Status | Issue | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|--------|-------|--------|------------|-------|
| üü° Monitoring | Backend API returns markdown only | High | Add structured JSON endpoint | Tech Lead |
| üü° Monitoring | No designer assigned yet | Medium | Conduct design sprint ourselves | Peter |
