- Standard MEARA takes 10-12 minutes and costs ~$6.45
- Too slow/expensive for screening 10+ companies
- Quarterly portfolio reviews cost $200+ per quarter
- No "quick sanity check" option before full analysis

### Solution
- Skip DeepStack and Deep Research Brief generation
- Lightweight website scraping (Playwright)
- Analyze 6 core dimensions (vs. 9 full)
- Use GPT-4o-mini (faster, cheaper)
- Generate 5-8 page concise report

### Comparison

| Feature | Standard MEARA | Fast-Track MEARA |
|---------|---------------|------------------|
| **Time** | 10-12 minutes | 2-3 minutes |
| **Cost** | ~$6.45 | ~$2.00 |
| **Dimensions** | 9 dimensions | 6 core dimensions |
| **Evidence Depth** | Deep (DeepStack + DRB + web research) | Surface (website only) |
| **Report Length** | 15-30 pages | 5-8 pages |
| **Use Cases** | Due diligence, strategic planning | Screening, quarterly checks |

### 6 Core Dimensions (Fast-Track)
1. **Message Clarity** - Is it clear what the company does?

4. **Social Proof & Trust Signals** - Customer logos, testimonials, reviews
5. **Website UX Fundamentals** - Navigation, mobile, usability
6. **Content Quality** - Professional, engaging, key pages present

### Excluded Dimensions (Standard Only)
7. Market Presence & Visibility (requires SEO research)
8. Audience Clarity & Segmentation (requires deep ICP analysis)
9. Analytics & Measurement Framework (requires technical audit)

### Use Cases

**1. Portfolio Quarterly Health Check**
- 25 companies √ó $2 = $50 (vs. $161 for Standard)
- 50 minutes (vs. 4+ hours)

**2. New Sector Exploration**
- Screen 15 companies ‚Üí Fast-Track all ($30, 30 min)
- Identify top 3 ‚Üí Standard analysis only on top 3 ($19, 30 min)
- Total: $49 and 1 hour (vs. $97 and 2.5 hours)

**3. Pre-Investment Quick Screen**
- Fast-Track in 2 minutes ($2)
- If score > 60 ‚Üí proceed to full due diligence
- If score < 60 ‚Üí pass or revisit later

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: MVP (1 week)
- Mode selection UI (Standard vs. Fast-Track)
- Lightweight website fetch (Playwright)
- 6-dimension analysis with GPT-4o-mini
- Basic report generation

#### Phase 2: Polish (3 days)
- Improve report formatting
- Add progress tracker (3 steps vs. 5)
- Markdown/PDF export
- Upgrade CTA to Standard MEARA

#### Phase 3: Optimization (1 week)
- Optimize API costs
- Reduce latency (caching, parallel calls)
- A/B test accuracy vs. Standard
- Target: 80-85% recommendation overlap with Standard

### Success Metrics
- Completion time (p90): < 3 minutes
- API cost: < $2.50 per analysis

## üéØ Decision Points

### Upcoming Decisions (Need Owner Input)

1. **Epic Priority (Week 4, Nov 2024)**
   - **Question:** After Phase 3 complete, prioritize Dashboard (002) or Library (003)?
   - **Context:** Both are high value; Dashboard is more user-facing, Library enables team collaboration
   - **Owner Decision Needed:** By October 28, 2024

2. **Fast-Track Scope (Q1 2025)**
   - **Question:** 6 dimensions correct, or should Fast-Track be 7-8 dimensions?
   - **Context:** 6 keeps cost/time low but may sacrifice too much accuracy
   - **Owner Decision Needed:** By December 2024

3. **Library Access Control (Q1 2025)**
   - **Question:** Default public (all Scale employees) or default private (opt-in sharing)?
   - **Context:** Affects collaboration vs. privacy trade-off
   - **Owner Decision Needed:** Before Library Phase 1

4. **Dashboard Design Sprint Timing (Q4 2024)**
   - **Question:** Conduct 5-day design sprint in-house or hire designer?
   - **Context:** In-house = faster but lower quality; external = slower but professional
   - **Owner Decision Needed:** By November 15, 2024
