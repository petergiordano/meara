1. Project Overview
The objective is to create a reusable, data-driven web application to display "GTM Scalability Briefing" reports for different portfolio companies.

The application will take a structured JSON data file as input and render an interactive, consistently styled HTML report based on the provided gtm_scalability_briefing_v2.html file, which serves as the visual and functional prototype.

2. Component Architecture
The application should be built using a component-based architecture (e.g., React, Vue, Svelte, or modern web components). The UI is composed of the following distinct components:

Header: Displays the main title and byline.

StrategicVerdict: A large card containing the GTM Maturity Model and the Core Narrative.

CoreAnalysis: A two-column layout containing the "Foundation for Scale" and "Primary Growth Bottlenecks" sections.

NarrativePillars: A section that dynamically renders a list of expandable "Pillar" cards.

ExecutionRoadmap: A three-column layout that dynamically renders the phased "Roadmap" cards.

1. Data Schema (The "API Contract")The application will be driven by a single JSON object. This structure is critical and must be followed precisely. 

Below is the full schema with example data populated from the GGWP v2 report.

      "GGWP has achieved impressive early traction by leveraging two world-class, but fundamentally unscalable, assets: a technically excellent product that solves an acute pain point and the unparalleled industry credibility of its founding team. This is the story of a company that has perfected the art of building a great product and leveraging a powerful network to land foundational accounts.",
      "However, the very strengths that have propelled GGWP to this point are now its primary bottlenecks to scalable growth. The company's go-to-market (GTM) engine is a pristine, impeccably crafted \"digital Savile Row suit with no pockets\"‚Äîa perfect exterior with no infrastructure to capture, measure, or optimize a sales funnel. The next phase of growth requires a deliberate architectural shift to a predictable, data-driven, and scalable revenue engine."

4. Design System & Styling
The visual design should be implemented as a reusable design system. All styling is defined in the prototype and should be replicated.

Framework: The prototype uses Tailwind CSS. This is the preferred method for styling.

Font: Inter. Weights used are 400 (Regular), 500 (Medium), 600 (Semi-Bold), 700 (Bold).

Colors:

Background: bg-gray-900 (#111827)

Card Background: bg-gray-800 (#1F2937)

Card Border: border-gray-700 (#374151)

Primary Text: text-gray-200

Secondary Text: text-gray-400

Accent (Active Maturity): bg-amber-500 (#F59E0B)

Accent (Foundation): text-green-400

Accent (Bottleneck): text-red-400

Accent (Pillar Arrow): text-blue-400

Pills: bg-blue-600, bg-indigo-600, bg-purple-600

5. Interaction Logic
The application must replicate the following interactive behaviors from the prototype:

Card Hover States: All cards (.card) should slightly brighten their border color on hover, as defined in the prototype's CSS.

Pillar Expand/Collapse: The "Narrative Pillar" cards are implemented using the <details> and <summary> HTML elements. This behavior should be replicated. A click on the summary toggles the visibility of the content, and the arrow icon should rotate 90 degrees.

By providing this structured guide, you're not just showing the engineer what to build, but also how to build it in a scalable and maintainable way.
