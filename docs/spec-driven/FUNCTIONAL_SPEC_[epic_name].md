### Error Handling Best Practices

**General Principles:**

1. **Be specific:** "Email is required" not "Invalid input"
2. **Be actionable:** Tell users what to do next
3. **Be reassuring:** "We're on it" not "Fatal error"
4. **Be contextual:** Show errors where they occur (inline)
5. **Be persistent:** Don't hide errors on scroll/tab change

**Error Message Template:**

```
[What went wrong] + [Why it matters] + [What to do next]

Examples:
‚ùå Bad: "Error 422"
‚úÖ Good: "Email address is already in use. Try logging in instead or use a different email."

‚ùå Bad: "Invalid format"
‚úÖ Good: "Phone number must be 10 digits. Example: 5551234567"

‚ùå Bad: "Server error"
‚úÖ Good: "We couldn't save your changes. Please try again in a moment."
```
