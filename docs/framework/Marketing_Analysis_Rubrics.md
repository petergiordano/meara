# Marketing Analysis Rubrics
(File Reference: Marketing_Analysis_Rubrics)
Version: 6.0

# **Global Evaluation Mandate: Assess Through the Lens of Scalability**

Every rating for every element in these rubrics **MUST** be primarily determined by its contribution to a **scalable, repeatable, and efficient GTM motion.** A technically perfect element that is a one-off or does not scale should be rated lower than a less-polished element that provides the foundation for a scalable system. This is the most important evaluation criterion.

# Using This Rubric with the Marketing Analysis Methodology

This rubric document works in conjunction with the `Strategic_Elements_Framework` document to ensure comprehensive marketing analysis. While these rubrics focus on dimension-specific assessment criteria, the `Strategic_Elements_Framework` provides cross-dimensional strategic evaluation guidance. Both documents should be used together for complete marketing effectiveness analysis.

While the user-provided Deep Research Brief provides critical context for your ratings, the specific 'Examples' cited in the dimension tables must be from artifacts directly reviewed and cited during the current analysis's evidence collection phase (as per `Marketing Analysis Methodology`, Step 2).

When applying these rubrics, the evaluator MUST consider insights and evidence presented in the user-provided 'Deep Research Brief' provided for the company. The brief may offer deeper context, identify non-obvious strengths or weaknesses, or highlight emerging trends that should influence the rating and qualitative assessment for each element. For instance, a 'Competent' surface-level execution might be downgraded if the user-provided Deep Research Brief reveals a significant missed strategic opportunity or an unaddressed emerging threat relevant to that element.

This rubric document contains detailed evaluation criteria for the nine dimensions assessed in the `Marketing_Analysis_Methodology` . [methodology document] For complete guidance on the analysis process:

1. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the methodology document  
2. Use this rubric to perform dimension evaluations in Step 3 of the methodology  
3. Reference specific criteria when documenting strengths and opportunities  
4. Use these criteria to identify patterns for root cause analysis (Step 4)  
5. Ensure recommendations (Step 5) address gaps identified using these rubrics

For questions about applying these rubrics, refer to [Section 3.1.5 "How to Use the Marketing Analysis Rubrics"] in the methodology document.

# Identifying Root Causes vs. Symptoms in Dimension Evaluation

When applying these rubrics, it's important to distinguish between:

1. **Unique Dimensional Issues:** Problems that originate within and primarily affect a single dimension  
2. **Cascading Manifestations:** Symptoms that appear in a dimension but stem from root causes in another dimension  
3. **Systemic Root Causes:** Fundamental strategic issues that create cascading effects across multiple dimensions

## Examples of Distinction:

| Dimension | Unique Issue Example | Cascading Manifestation Example | Potential Root Cause |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Positioning | Technical language inconsistency | Generic value proposition | **Unclear ICP Definition** |
| Buyer Journey | Missing middle-funnel content | Inconsistent persona targeting | **Audience Clarity Gap** |
| Digital Experience | Slow page loading speed | Confusing conversion paths | **Conversion Architecture Flaw** |
| Competitive Positioning | Missing competitor comparison page | Inability to articulate differentiation | **Positioning Weakness** |

### Pattern Identification Process:

1. Evaluate each dimension independently using the rubrics  
2. Note when similar issues appear across multiple dimensions  
3. Consider which issues might be symptoms versus causes  
4. In your findings documentation, distinguish between:  
   - "Unique finding in [Dimension]" for issues specific to that dimension  
   - "Manifestation of [Root Cause]" for symptoms of a broader issue

This approach will facilitate more accurate root cause identification and help prioritize recommendations that address fundamental issues rather than just their symptoms.

## Cross-Dimensional Analysis Guidelines

After evaluating all dimensions, follow these steps to identify interconnections:

1. **Look for Recurring Patterns:**  
     
   * Identify similar issues that appear across multiple dimensions  
   * Note consistent language or themes in evaluation ratings

   

2. **Map Potential Root Causes:**  
     
   * Consider which dimensions most frequently show critical gaps  
   * Look for "upstream" issues that could cause "downstream" symptoms  
   * Identify which dimension issues must be resolved before others can improve

   

3. **Assign Relationship Types:**  
     
   * **Causal:** Root cause directly creates problems in another dimension  
   * **Dependency:** Dimension issues cannot be fixed until another is addressed  
   * **Bidirectional:** Dimensions mutually reinforce issues in each other

   

4. **Document Severity Patterns:**  
     
   * Track the severity level of related issues across dimensions  
   * Note when a minor issue in one dimension creates critical gaps in others

   

5. **Prepare for Visualization:**  
     
   * Organize findings to support creation of the Findings Relationship Map  
   * Group related symptoms by potential root causes  
   * Note severity levels for each manifestation

## **Assessment Rubrics for Primary Marketing Dimensions**

Trying to capture the majority of high-impact insights while establishing a framework that makes completing the full assessment methodology straightforward.

### Market Positioning & Messaging

**Assessment Focus:** Clarity, distinctiveness, and resonance of the value proposition in addressing target customer pain points and defining market/category position.

| Element | Exceptional | Competent | Needs Improvement | Critical Gap |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Value Proposition Clarity** | Value proposition is immediately clear, differentiated, and customer-outcome focused | Value proposition is reasonably clear but may lack some differentiation | Value proposition is vague or focused on features rather than outcomes | Value proposition is absent, confusing, or fundamentally misaligned with market needs |
| **Pain Point Articulation** | Pain points are vividly described using customer language with quantified impact | Pain points are identified but with limited quantification or resonance | Pain points are generic or not well-connected to the solution | Pain points are missing or fundamentally misunderstood |
| **Differentiation Framework** | Clear, compelling differentiation from alternatives with substantiated claims | Basic differentiation that relies primarily on feature comparison | Weak differentiation that fails to establish meaningful uniqueness | No meaningful differentiation from alternatives |
| **Category Definition** | Creates or clearly owns a distinct product category, potentially identified as a 'Breakthrough Spark' or strategic opportunity in the user-provided  Deep Research Brief, and supports it with extensive educational content, a compelling narrative, and evidence of market resonance or emerging leadership. Demonstrates strong potential for category leadership based on a unique vision or approach, as may be indicated by deep research insights.  | Fits clearly within an established category but doesn't lead it | Category placement is ambiguous or inconsistently communicated | Category confusion or inappropriate category placement |
| **Objection Handling** | Proactively addresses key objections with evidence and reframing | Addresses some obvious objections but may miss subtle concerns | Limited objection handling focused only on surface issues | No visible objection handling strategy |
| **ROI Articulation** | Clear, credible ROI framework with customer-relevant metrics and proof points | Basic ROI claims with limited substantiation or customization | Vague assertions about value without specific metrics | No attempt to quantify business impact |
| **Market Education** | Extensive educational content that builds category understanding and need recognition | Some educational content but gaps in market development | Minimal education, assumes market understanding | No market education, assumes fully educated prospects |
| **Business Impact Articulation** | Clear connection between positioning and revenue outcomes with quantified impact | Some connection between positioning and business results | Limited connection to business performance | No connection between positioning and business outcomes |
| **Business Outcome Focus** | Recommendations directly tied to revenue, growth, or competitive metrics | Some connection to business outcomes but not fully quantified | Focus on activities rather than outcomes | No clear business impact articulated |
| **Specificity & Actionability** | Detailed, specific actions with clear ownership and timeline | Generally clear actions but some ambiguity in execution | Vague directives without clear next steps | Generic suggestions with no implementation path |
| **Resource Calibration** | Accurately scoped for company size and stage with realistic resource needs | Generally appropriate resource requirements | Some recommendations exceed realistic capabilities | Recommendations require unreasonable resources |
| **Prioritization Logic** | Clear rationale for sequencing based on dependencies and impact | Some prioritization logic but incomplete | Limited consideration of sequence or dependencies | No clear prioritization approach |

**Strategic Elements Integration:** When evaluating this dimension, refer to the `Strategic_Elements_Framework` sections on Category Definition & Leadership and Technology Positioning Authenticity for additional assessment criteria and examples.

**Note on Cascading Effects:** Issues in Market Positioning & Messaging frequently cascade to affect multiple other dimensions:

- Generic value propositions often manifest in Competitive Positioning as weak differentiation  
- Unclear messaging typically impacts Digital Experience through confusing CTAs  
- Underdeveloped pain point articulation can affect Buyer Journey content relevance

When evaluating this dimension, note potential interconnections to flag for Root Cause Analysis.

### Buyer Journey Orchestration 

**Assessment Focus:** Cohesion and coverage of full-funnel marketing efforts that guide the buyer from awareness through consideration to conversion with relevant content and paths.

| Element | Exceptional | Competent | Needs Improvement | Critical Gap |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Awareness Stage Content** | Rich, diverse content targeted at problem recognition for different personas | Basic awareness content that addresses main pain points | Limited awareness content that reaches only obvious prospects | No dedicated awareness-stage content |
| **Consideration Stage Resources** | Comprehensive resources helping buyers evaluate options and build business case | Standard comparison content and basic evaluation tools | Limited comparison resources or evaluation support | No consideration phase support content |
| **Decision Facilitation** | Sophisticated tools to reduce friction and support consensus building | Basic tools that facilitate individual decision-making | Limited decision support focused primarily on pricing | No specific decision facilitation tools |
| **Engagement Diversity** | Multiple engagement options tailored to buyer preferences, information needs, and commitment levels at all stages of the funnel, from low-friction (e.g., newsletter, resource download, interactive quiz/tool, webinar) to high-friction (e.g., demo, sales call). Clear pathways for prospects to self-educate and engage lightly before committing to sales interaction. | Several engagement options but limited personalization | Few engagement options, mostly high-commitment or lacking readily available, low-friction paths for early-stage prospects. | Single engagement path requiring high commitment, with no alternative ways for prospects to learn or engage at earlier stages. |
| **Lead Capture Strategy** | Strategically placed, value-based lead capture with clear next steps | Standard lead capture forms with reasonable value exchange | Lead capture that feels premature or offers limited value | Aggressive or low-value lead capture creating friction |
| **Buying Committee Support** | Content and tools specifically designed for different committee roles | Some recognition of multiple stakeholders in buying process | Limited focus on the individual buyer only | No acknowledgment of complex B2B buying process |
| **Nurture & Reengagement** | Sophisticated nurture strategy with trigger-based engagement | Basic nurture sequences with limited personalization | Limited follow-up or generic nurture approach | No visible nurture or reengagement strategy |
| **Business Outcome Focus** | Recommendations directly tied to revenue, growth, or competitive metrics | Some connection to business outcomes but not fully quantified | Focus on activities rather than outcomes | No clear business impact articulated |
| **Specificity & Actionability** | Detailed, specific actions with clear ownership and timeline | Generally clear actions but some ambiguity in execution | Vague directives without clear next steps | Generic suggestions with no implementation path |
| **Resource Calibration** | Accurately scoped for company size and stage with realistic resource needs | Generally appropriate resource requirements | Some recommendations exceed realistic capabilities | Recommendations require unreasonable resources |
| **Prioritization Logic** | Clear rationale for sequencing based on dependencies and impact | Some prioritization logic but incomplete | Limited consideration of sequence or dependencies | No clear prioritization approach |

**Note on Cascading Effects:** Issues in Buyer Journey Orchestration often manifest from or impact other dimensions:

- Missing middle-funnel content may reflect Audience Clarity gaps in understanding prospect needs  
- Conversion friction often relates to Digital Experience issues with CTA design or page flow  
- Lack of role-specific content typically connects to Audience Clarity & Segmentation weaknesses

Watch for these cross-dimensional dependencies when evaluating buyer journey components.

**Strategic Elements Integration:** When evaluating this dimension, refer to the `Strategic_Elements_Framework` section on Buying Committee Dynamics for additional assessment criteria and examples.

### Market Presence & Visibility

**Assessment Focus:** Strength of brand footprint, discoverability through search and AI, and third-party validation signals.

| Element | Exceptional | Competent | Needs Improvement | Critical Gap |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Search Visibility** | Dominant rankings for category and problem-based queries | Solid rankings for some key terms but gaps in coverage | Fundamental on-page SEO elements such as page titles, meta descriptions, URL structures, navigation clarity for key resources/product info, or product/feature page naming conventions are generic, use internal jargon, or fail to incorporate relevant category/benefit keywords, hindering user understanding and search engine discoverability. Content may lack clear structure (e.g. poor heading hierarchy, dense text blocks) making it difficult for machines to parse effectively. | Poor search visibility even for branded terms |
| **AI Engine Optimization & Recommendation Readiness** | Content is highly structured, utilizes clear semantic language, and strategically employs relevant and correctly implemented schema markup (e.g., for products, services, FAQs, reviews, how-to articles, events) where appropriate. This demonstrably facilitates accurate interpretation and enhanced surfacing by AI engines, chatbots, and modern search algorithms. The company and its core offerings are frequently and accurately recommended by relevant AI-powered discovery tools for pertinent queries, supported by its strong public data signals and easily parsable content, and this aligns with or is validated by specific findings on 'AI Engine Perception & Digital Body Language' in the user-provided  Deep Research Brief. Key entity information about the company, its products, services, and expertise is consistently and clearly presented across the digital presence, making it easy for machines to understand 'who they are,' 'what they do,' and 'why they are relevant.' | Website content is generally clear and well-organized, allowing AI engines and search algorithms to extract information with reasonable accuracy. Basic AEO principles (e.g., logical heading structure, clear entity descriptions) are considered. The company's presence in AI-generated summaries is adequate but may lack the prominence or nuanced accuracy suggested as optimal by the  user-provided Deep Research Brief's 'AI Engine Perception' findings. Some schema markup may be present but not comprehensively or strategically applied.  | Inconsistent language, poor content structure, limited or incorrect schema markup, or lack of clarity hinders effective AI engine and search algorithm interpretation. Basic AEO best practices are not evident. The company may be poorly represented or inconsistently surfaced in AI-generated summaries, a situation potentially highlighted by the user-provided  Deep Research Brief, indicating a missed opportunity for better AI recommendation readiness. | Content is difficult for AI engines and search algorithms to parse effectively due to poor structure, unclear language, or lack of semantic cues; information is frequently misinterpreted or not surfaced optimally by AI-driven discovery tools, potentially confirmed or detailed as a significant issue in the user-provided Deep Research Brief's 'AI Engine Perception' analysis. No discernible AEO strategy or foundational practices (like structured data for key information or clear heading hierarchies) are apparent.  |
| **Third-Party Validation** | Extensive reviews across platforms with strong ratings and case studies | Moderate review presence with generally positive sentiment | Limited reviews primarily on a single platform | No visible third-party validation |
| **Media & Analyst Coverage** | Regular, substantive coverage in industry publications and analyst reports | Some media mentions and occasional analyst recognition | Limited coverage primarily through self-placed content | No significant media or analyst coverage |
| **Social Proof Diversity** | Rich mix of testimonials, case studies, statistics, social signals, and active highlighting of notable past achievements/awards or strong positive community feedback. Systematically resurfaces and integrates evidence of past major successful initiatives, well-received events (e.g., a previous [generic example: widely cited company research report or a successful keynote at a major industry event] with positive documented outcomes), or highly positive historical community feedback into ongoing marketing and as prominent social proof. | Standard testimonials and basic case studies | Fails to leverage or make visible documented past successes or well-received historical initiatives (e.g., a popular [generic example: series of expert interviews or a significant product innovation from a prior year] that built brand equity) in current marketing efforts. | No meaningful social proof elements |
| **Digital Footprint Breadth** | Active presence across multiple relevant channels with consistent engagement, leveraging historical successes where appropriate.	 | Presence on major platforms with irregular engagement | Limited presence on few platforms with minimal activity | Minimal digital footprint beyond website |
| **Community Engagement** | Vibrant community with active discussion and peer-to-peer engagement | Some community elements with limited interaction | Minimal community presence or engagement | No visible community strategy |
| **Competitive Ad Defense** | Strong branded search presence with no, or only minimal and demonstrably insignificant, direct competitor ad encroachment on primary branded keywords (company name, primary product names) on the first page of search results; clear strategy in place to actively monitor and vigorously defend branded SERPs, potentially including defensive bidding or other countermeasures if significant threats emerge. | Some competitive ads on branded terms but good organic position | Significant competitive advertising on branded terms | Company's primary brand terms are consistently and heavily targeted by multiple competitor ads appearing prominently on the first page of search results, indicating a significant vulnerability and potential traffic/brand erosion, with no apparent counter-strategy or acknowledgment of this significant brand hijacking and traffic diversion issue. |
| **Review Platform Optimization** | Strong presence on G2, Capterra, and TrustRadius with category leadership and strategic reviewer engagement | Solid review presence on major platforms with consistently positive ratings and basic review acquisition | Limited reviews on only one platform with minimal management of presence | No review platform presence (e.g., on G2, Capterra) despite the product category having established review sites commonly used by buyers. This typically constitutes a critical quick win opportunity: e.g., 'Action: Establish presence on G2 and initiate review collection. |
| **Business Outcome Focus** | Recommendations directly tied to revenue, growth, or competitive metrics | Some connection to business outcomes but not fully quantified | Focus on activities rather than outcomes | No clear business impact articulated |
| **Specificity & Actionability** | Detailed, specific actions with clear ownership and timeline | Generally clear actions but some ambiguity in execution | Vague directives without clear next steps | Generic suggestions with no implementation path |
| **Resource Calibration** | Accurately scoped for company size and stage with realistic resource needs | Generally appropriate resource requirements | Some recommendations exceed realistic capabilities | Recommendations require unreasonable resources |
| **Prioritization Logic** | Clear rationale for sequencing based on dependencies and impact | Some prioritization logic but incomplete | Limited consideration of sequence or dependencies | No clear prioritization approach |

**Note on Cascading Effects:** This dimension frequently reflects issues originating elsewhere:

- Poor search rankings often stem from Market Positioning weaknesses with unclear category alignment  
- Limited third-party validation may connect to Competitive Positioning gaps  
- Weak social proof typically relates to Brand Consistency issues across channels

Consider how performance in this dimension may be a manifestation of more fundamental strategic issues.

### Audience Clarity & Segmentation

**Assessment Focus:** Ability to define, segment, and tailor marketing efforts to clear, high-propensity-to-buy audiences.

| Element | Exceptional | Competent | Needs Improvement | Critical Gaps |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **ICP Definition** | Distinct ICPs defined with detailed firmographics, technographics, psychographics, and JTBD context | Defined ICP with firmographics and broad needs outlined | ICP described in vague or overly broad terms | No clear ICP definition or segmentation visible |
| **Persona Depth** | Includes primary and secondary personas that are deeply informed by insights similar to those found in the 'True Voice of the Customer & Unarticulated Needs' section of the user-provided Deep Research Brief. Personas reflect nuanced understanding of roles, true underlying challenges (the 'pain behind the pain'), core motivations, actual customer language/jargon, decision-making processes, and critical buying context, leading to highly resonant and effective targeting. | One or two primary personas are defined with clear roles, general pain points, and motivations. While not fully leveraging deep research insights on unarticulated needs or precise customer language, the personas provide a reasonable basis for general targeting and content creation. There's an opportunity to enrich these with deeper 'Voice of the Customer' data if available in the user-provided  Deep Research Brief.  | Personas are superficial, lack depth, are based on assumptions rather than research, or do not clearly define the buying context. They may not align with, or fail to incorporate, crucial insights regarding actual customer language, 'pain behind the pain,' or unarticulated needs that might be present in the user-provided  Deep Research Brief, leading to generic or misaligned messaging.  | No evidence of defined personas or any attempt to understand nuanced customer insights, motivations, or language. Marketing efforts appear to be based on broad generalizations, ignoring readily available or discoverable deep customer understanding (which might be highlighted as missing or present in the user-provided Deep Research Brief).  |
| **Segment Differentiation** | Tailored messaging and offers by vertical, size, maturity, or use case | Some customization for key segments visible | Generic messaging with light references to segments | Messaging is universal; no differentiation by segment |
| **Qualification Logic** | Explicit qualification criteria tied to use case fit, value drivers, or funnel stage | Clear top-level criteria but lacks depth in use case alignment | Ad hoc or ambiguous qualification guidance | No visible qualification criteria |
| **Journey Mapping by Segment** | Buyer journey mapped for each segment with stage-based needs/content | Partial mapping with attention to some stages or segments | Generic journey mapping or stage-based gaps | No buyer journey mapping present |
| **Behavioral Triggers** | Segmentation reflects behavioral and intent signals | Some behavioral signals used, but inconsistently | Basic behavioral cues or manual triggers | No behavioral or intent-driven segmentation visible |
| **Role-Based Engagement** | Campaigns clearly mapped to buying roles across the deal team | Some role-based targeting, mostly for decision-makers | Limited recognition of multiple stakeholders | One-size-fits-all content across roles |
| **Buying Committee Enablement** | Complete content and tools specifically designed for each committee role (economic buyer, technical evaluator, end user) with targeted objection handling and resources for internal champions to address and reframe potential detractor concerns (e.g., specific anxieties about job displacement, implementation complexity, ROI doubts, or resistance to change identified for each role). | Materials addressing the main committee roles with some role-specific messaging | Content primarily focused on a single decision-maker with limited consideration of other stakeholders or proactive messaging for potential internal detractors. | No recognition of buying committee dynamics or multi-stakeholder decision processes |
| **Business Outcome Focus** | Recommendations directly tied to revenue, growth, or competitive metrics | Some connection to business outcomes but not fully quantified | Focus on activities rather than outcomes | No clear business impact articulated |
| **Specificity & Actionability** | Detailed, specific actions with clear ownership and timeline | Generally clear actions but some ambiguity in execution | Vague directives without clear next steps | Generic suggestions with no implementation path |
| **Resource Calibration** | Accurately scoped for company size and stage with realistic resource needs | Generally appropriate resource requirements | Some recommendations exceed realistic capabilities | Recommendations require unreasonable resources |
| **Prioritization Logic** | Clear rationale for sequencing based on dependencies and impact | Some prioritization logic but incomplete | Limited consideration of sequence or dependencies | No clear prioritization approach |

**Note on Cascading Effects:** This dimension is frequently a root cause for issues across other dimensions:

- Unclear ICP definition typically manifests in Market Positioning as generic messaging  
- Weak persona development affects Buyer Journey through misaligned content  
- Limited segmentation strategies impact Brand Consistency through conflicting messaging

When evaluating this dimension, consider its foundational role in enabling effective execution across other areas.

### Digital Experience Effectiveness

**Assessment Focus:** Website clarity, conversion readiness, and experience quality for buyer research and validation.

| Element | Exceptional | Competent | Needs Improvement | Critical Gaps |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Info Architecture** | Clear, intuitive structure with guided flows by persona or use case | Logical structure with clear product and resource paths | Disjointed or inconsistent nav/UX | Navigation confusion, buried pages |
| **Conversion Path Clarity** | Clear CTAs mapped to intent levels; frictionless demo/trial/signup | CTAs visible and working; basic segmentation by funnel stage | Weak or buried CTAs; limited lead capture strategy | No clear paths to conversion or broken CTAs |
| **Content Layout & Density** | Balanced, scannable content using hierarchy and visual clarity | Mostly scannable with some visual cues and clarity | Text-heavy or inconsistent formatting | Walls of text, poor readability |
| **Page Speed & Mobile** | Fast load times; optimized for all screen sizes | Acceptable speed; mobile-friendly | Slower load or inconsistent on mobile | Painfully slow or broken on mobile |
| **Friction in Key Flows** | Optimized for lowest friction: signup, pricing, demo booking, search | Functional but contains minor friction points | Friction in common tasks or unclear next steps | High abandonment risk due to poor UX flows |
| **Search & Discovery** | Internal search works well, content easily discoverable | Basic search available and somewhat functional | Hard to find key info; poor search relevance | No search or broken content discovery |
| **Trust Signals & Validation** | Strong 3rd-party proof: case studies, logos, G2/Trustpilot, etc. | Some validation, logos, or quotes | Light or old validation | No validation, trust signals, or testimonials |
| **Business Outcome Focus** | Recommendations directly tied to revenue, growth, or competitive metrics | Some connection to business outcomes but not fully quantified | Focus on activities rather than outcomes | No clear business impact articulated |
| **Specificity & Actionability** | Detailed, specific actions with clear ownership and timeline | Generally clear actions but some ambiguity in execution | Vague directives without clear next steps | Generic suggestions with no implementation path |
| **Resource Calibration** | Accurately scoped for company size and stage with realistic resource needs | Generally appropriate resource requirements | Some recommendations exceed realistic capabilities | Recommendations require unreasonable resources |
| **Prioritization Logic** | Clear rationale for sequencing based on dependencies and impact | Some prioritization logic but incomplete | Limited consideration of sequence or dependencies | No clear prioritization approach |
| **Technology Leadership & Innovation Showcase (Presentation & IA)** | Website structure and content presentation strongly reflect best practices of leading technology-innovative companies relevant to their sector. This includes a dedicated, easily discoverable, and prominently featured section (e.g., 'Our Technology,' 'Innovation Insights,' 'R\&D Highlights,' 'Engineering Blog,' or 'Research Portal' – distinct from simply a general blog) that effectively showcases expertise, future vision, and the depth of their technological approach. The company successfully blends deep technical content (where appropriate for specific audiences, e.g., data sheets, architectural diagrams) with clear, compelling business value narratives, cultivating an overall innovative, credible, and forward-thinking brand perception through its digital experience. |  | Website feels like a standard B2B SaaS site, with limited specific effort to structurally or stylistically showcase its technological depth or innovation, even if these are claimed as differentiators. Technical content, if present, may be hard to find, not well-integrated with business value propositions, or not presented in a manner (e.g., via dedicated 'Technology' or 'Research' sections) that builds strong credibility as a tech leader. | The digital experience does not project an identity of technological leadership or innovation, even if this is a core part of the company's value proposition. The website structure and content presentation are generic, outdated, or fail to build confidence in the company's specific technical capabilities or forward vision; lacks dedicated sections for deeper tech insights or innovation showcases. |
| **Business Outcome Focus** | Recommendations directly tied to revenue, growth, or competitive metrics | Some connection to business outcomes but not fully quantified | Focus on activities rather than outcomes | No clear business impact articulated |
| **Specificity & Actionability** | Detailed, specific actions with clear ownership and timeline | Generally clear actions but some ambiguity in execution | Vague directives without clear next steps | Generic suggestions with no implementation path |
| **Resource Calibration** | Accurately scoped for company size and stage with realistic resource needs | Generally appropriate resource requirements | Some recommendations exceed realistic capabilities | Recommendations require unreasonable resources |
| **Prioritization Logic** | Clear rationale for sequencing based on dependencies and impact | Some prioritization logic but incomplete | Limited consideration of sequence or dependencies | No clear prioritization approach |

**Note on Cascading Effects:** Digital experience issues often connect bidirectionally with other dimensions:

- Navigation confusion may stem from Audience Clarity gaps around user needs and priorities  
- CTA clarity issues typically reflect Market Positioning weaknesses in value articulation  
- Trust signal gaps often connect to Market Presence & Visibility limitations

Look for these interconnections when evaluating digital experience components.

### Competitive Positioning & Defense

**Assessment Focus:** Strength and clarity of product differentiation, market narrative, and brand defense.

| Element | Exceptional | Competent | Needs Improvement | Critical Gaps |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Differentiation Clarity** | Clear, ownable value proposition that sharply contrasts with named alternatives (including indirect and emerging ones potentially identified in the user-provided  Deep Research Brief's 'Unseen Competitive Landscape' analysis). Differentiation is substantiated, addresses competitor 'Shadow Strategies' where discernible, and proactively neutralizes competitor claims or FUD. The company's unique position leverages identified market 'fault lines' or white spaces.  | Defined differentiators tied to use case or tech | Vague claims; limited distinction | Generic messaging; undifferentiated from others |
| **Branded Keyword Defense Strategy** | Actively monitors and mitigates competitor bidding on branded keywords; may employ defensive ad campaigns or other tactics to maintain SERP dominance for brand |  |  | Significant competitor presence on branded keywords with no defensive actions or strategy apparent |
| **Competitive Narrative** | Proactive, story-driven framing of market and competition, including clear counter-narratives to competitor FUD or misinformation. | Mentions competition or offers comparison tools | Only indirect references to competitors | No mention or denial of competitive landscape |
| **"Why Now" Argument** | A compelling and proactive 'Why Act Now?' narrative is clearly articulated, tailored to the ICP's context, and consistently reinforced across relevant touchpoints. It is driven by undeniable external forces (e.g., market shifts, regulatory deadlines), significant pain acceleration if the core problem is unaddressed, clear and quantifiable first-mover advantages, or a rapidly closing window of opportunity that resonates with the buyer's priorities. | Some time-based rationale presented | Weak urgency; more nice-to-have than need-to-have | No clear or compelling reason is provided for why a buyer should act now versus delaying a decision; the solution is positioned as a 'nice-to-have' or a future consideration without persuasive urgency drivers relevant to the current business environment of the target customer.  |
| **Win Stories** | Case studies or narrative examples illustrating competitive wins | Some case studies with value proof | Generic success stories, lacks competitor focus | No compelling evidence of market wins |
| **Switch Incentive Strategy** | Messaging targets pain of current state, friction reduction, ROI | Some effort to show upgrade value vs. status quo | Weak incentive to switch; no competitor pain highlighted | No comparative framing or switching motivation |
| **Defensive Moats** | Signals of IP, tech uniqueness, network effects, integrations, or scale | One or two defensibility levers mentioned | Low barrier to replication evident | Easily replicable, no defense mechanisms |
| **Category Storytelling** | Frames a compelling market category where product leads | Mentions category or ecosystem role | No real category stake or leadership narrative | Passive participant, reactive positioning |
| **AI vs. Legacy Positioning** | Clear articulation of AI advantages over traditional approaches with quantified gains | Basic comparison of AI vs. manual methods | Limited explanation of AI advantage | No differentiation between AI and non-AI solutions |
| **Technology Adoption Urgency** | Compelling "why now" narrative tied to market timing and competitive advantage | Some urgency drivers but not clearly tied to market conditions | Weak case for immediate adoption | No clear reason for urgency in adoption |
| **Competitive Disadvantage Awareness** | Clear recognition of competitive weaknesses with specific mitigation strategies | Some awareness of competitive gaps with partial mitigation | Limited recognition of competitive vulnerabilities | No acknowledgment of competitive disadvantages |
| **Business Outcome Focus** | Recommendations directly tied to revenue, growth, or competitive metrics | Some connection to business outcomes but not fully quantified | Focus on activities rather than outcomes | No clear business impact articulated |
| **Specificity & Actionability** | Detailed, specific actions with clear ownership and timeline | Generally clear actions but some ambiguity in execution | Vague directives without clear next steps | Generic suggestions with no implementation path |
| **Resource Calibration** | Accurately scoped for company size and stage with realistic resource needs | Generally appropriate resource requirements | Some recommendations exceed realistic capabilities | Recommendations require unreasonable resources |
| **Prioritization Logic** | Clear rationale for sequencing based on dependencies and impact | Some prioritization logic but incomplete | Limited consideration of sequence or dependencies | No clear prioritization approach |

**Note on Cascading Effects:** The interconnections between this dimension and others include:

- Competitive positioning weakness often appears in Market Presence as reduced category leadership  
- Undifferentiated value claims typically affect Digital Experience through generic CTAs  
- Weak "Why Now" urgency drivers impact Buyer Journey conversion rates

Consider how competitive positioning issues might be manifestations of or contributors to root causes.

### Brand & Message Consistency

**Assessment Focus:** Cross-channel clarity, coherence, and brand identity presence.

| Element | Exceptional | Competent | Needs Improvement | Critical Gaps |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Messaging Consistency** | Uniform value proposition and phrasing across all digital surfaces | Mostly consistent messaging; minor variation | Inconsistent tone or terminology across key pages | Disjointed, conflicting value props or taglines |
| **Visual Identity** | Strong, distinctive visual identity applied universally | Visual consistency on most properties | Inconsistent brand visuals or amateur design | No cohesive brand visuals or identity |
| **Terminology Discipline** | Controlled vocabulary, aligned with ICP language and internal consistency | Mostly standardized terms with occasional gaps | Disjointed or conflicting terminology | Fragmented and confusing language across assets |
| **Voice & Tone** | Defined brand voice expressed consistently across channels | Consistent tone in most channels | Unclear or varying tone depending on content | Jarring voice changes; lack of identity |
| **Brand Architecture** | Clear relationship between product(s), company, and message hierarchy | Some clarity in sub-brand/product relationships | Brand-product confusion or dilution | Confused brand architecture; unclear hierarchy |
| **Channel Alignment** | Social, website, blog, and paid all reinforce core message | Most channels aligned; minor gaps | Some channels misaligned with positioning | Messaging mismatch across major platforms |
| **Brand Personality Expression** | Personality (e.g., bold, helpful, witty) expressed consistently | Some tone/personality consistency | Generic tone, lacks personality | No personality or inconsistent tone |
| **Business Outcome Focus** | Recommendations directly tied to revenue, growth, or competitive metrics | Some connection to business outcomes but not fully quantified | Focus on activities rather than outcomes | No clear business impact articulated |

| **Prioritization Logic** | Clear rationale for sequencing based on dependencies and impact | Some prioritization logic but incomplete | Limited consideration of sequence or dependencies | No clear prioritization approach |

**Note on Cascading Effects:** This dimension both reveals and impacts issues across other areas:

- Incomplete funnel metrics often reflect Buyer Journey Orchestration gaps in mapping the complete path  
- Attribution challenges typically connect to Digital Experience issues with conversion tracking  
- Weak optimization signals impact Market Positioning through limited insight into message effectiveness

Consider both how measurement gaps may cause issues elsewhere and reveal underlying problems.

### Evaluation of AI-Specific Authenticity

**Assessment Focus:** Evaluation of AI authenticity, technical credibility, and go-to-market sophistication specific to AI-native products and their unique positioning requirements.

| Element | Exceptional | Competent | Needs Improvement | Critical Gap |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **AI Authenticity** | Still clearly AI-driven if the word "AI" were removed; demonstrated through technical depth and capabilities | AI capabilities evident beyond labeling, with some technical validation | Relies heavily on "AI" labeling with minimal substantiation | AI positioning disappears completely when the word "AI" is removed |
| **Nuanced AI-Native 'Feel** | Beyond explicit AI claims, the overall digital presence consistently projects a strong, authentic sense of being an AI-native, forward-thinking organization. This "feel" is innovative, deeply embedded (not superficial), and validated by observations similar to a 'Digital Body Language Audit' found in the user-provided  Deep Research Brief, considering website aesthetics, UX, content style and depth, information architecture (e.g., prominent 'Research' or 'Technology Innovation' sections), and an overall projection of genuine innovation.  | The digital presence generally aligns with AI positioning, but the 'AI-native feel' might not be consistently strong across all touchpoints or could be enhanced in specific areas (e.g., IA, content depth). | The 'AI-native feel' is weak or inconsistent. AI claims seem more like an add-on to a traditional SaaS offering rather than an integral part of the company's DNA as reflected in its digital experience. | The digital presence does not evoke any sense of AI nativity or innovation; claims of being AI-driven feel entirely misaligned with the user experience and presentation style. |
| **Technical Credibility** | Rich technical content blended with business messaging; explains AI architecture, data models, and unique approaches | Some technical content about AI functionality, but limited depth or specificity	 | Minimal technical detail on how AI actually works, or overly generic explanations | No technical content supporting AI claims, or claims are unsubstantiated |
| **Internal Detractor Messaging** | Comprehensive content, tools, and messaging specifically designed to proactively address potential resistance, fear, or skepticism from various stakeholder types within customer organizations, providing evidence-based counter-points and champion enablement materials. | Some content addressing potential concerns of resistors or change management. | Limited acknowledgment of potential resistance, or generic reassurances. | No consideration of internal adoption challenges, user resistance, or change management needs. |
| **AI Proof Points** | Concrete, interactive demonstrations of AI capabilities (e.g., live demos, sandboxes, data visualizations of AI impact), and measurable results from real-world use. | Some demonstrations of AI in action, but limited quantification or interactivity. | Claims about AI capabilities without significant proof or tangible examples. | No evidence supporting AI functionality claims beyond assertions. |
| **AI Development Approach** | Clear explanation of AI development methodology, training approach, and continuous improvement process | Basic information about AI development without significant detail | Vague references to AI development without methodology | No information about how AI is built or improved |
| **Technical Credibility Signaling** | Deep technical content establishing AI expertise; demonstrates data science leadership | Adequate technical explanation of AI approaches | Surface-level technical content with limited depth | No technical substantiation of AI claims |
| **AI vs. Traditional Solution Contrast** | Clear, quantified, and specific comparison between the AI solution and legacy/traditional approaches, highlighting tangible advantages in efficiency, outcomes, or new capabilities. | Basic comparison of AI vs. traditional methods | Limited explanation of AI advantage, or generic benefit statements. | No differentiation between AI and non-AI solutions, or unclear value proposition of AI. |
| **Business Outcome Focus** | Recommendations directly tied to revenue, growth, or competitive metrics | Some connection to business outcomes but not fully quantified | Focus on activities rather than outcomes | No clear business impact articulated |
| **Specificity & Actionability** | Detailed, specific actions with clear ownership and timeline | Generally clear actions but some ambiguity in execution | Vague directives without clear next steps | Generic suggestions with no implementation path |
| **Resource Calibration** | Accurately scoped for company size and stage with realistic resource needs | Generally appropriate resource requirements | Some recommendations exceed realistic capabilities | Recommendations require unreasonable resources |
| **Prioritization Logic** | Clear rationale for sequencing based on dependencies and impact | Some prioritization logic but incomplete | Limited consideration of sequence or dependencies | No clear prioritization approach |

**Note on Cascading Effects:** AI authenticity issues frequently connect to broader marketing challenges:

- Technical credibility gaps often manifest in Market Positioning as vague value propositions  
- Internal detractor messaging weaknesses impact Buyer Journey effectiveness for complex AI solutions  
- Proof point limitations typically affect Competitive Positioning against both AI and non-AI alternatives

For AI-focused solutions, these interconnections are particularly critical to identify and address.

# Example Application: Root Cause Analysis and Cross-Referencing

Below is an example showing how to document findings using the cross-referencing approach:

## Root Cause Documentation

**Root Cause: Generic Value Proposition** **Description:** Messaging lacks specificity and differentiation, blending in with competitors.

**Affects These Dimensions:**

- **Market Positioning: CRITICAL** - Homepage messaging fails to articulate unique value  
- **Competitive Positioning: HIGH** - No clear distinction from alternatives  
- **Brand Consistency: MEDIUM** - Inconsistent value articulation across channels  
- **Buyer Journey: MEDIUM** - Weak motivation to progress through funnel

**Supporting Evidence:**

- "We help businesses improve productivity" [Homepage: https://example.com]  
- Competitor X, Y, and Z all use similar generic claims  
- No quantified outcomes or customer-specific benefits

**Business Implications:** Extended sales cycles, increased price sensitivity, and higher customer acquisition costs due to lack of perceived differentiation.

## Dimension-Specific Finding with Cross-Reference

**Market Positioning & Messaging** **Rating:** Needs Work

**Strengths:**

* Pain points are clearly articulated using customer language: "We understand that manual reporting costs you 15 hours per week" — [Homepage: https://example.com]  
* Category is clearly defined as "Revenue Intelligence Platform" — [Product page: https://example.com/product]

**Opportunities:**

* Value proposition lacks differentiation (Manifestation of Generic Value Proposition root cause)  
* No quantified ROI or business impact metrics provided — [Pricing page: https://example.com/pricing]  
* Competitive alternatives not acknowledged or addressed — [All pages reviewed]

This interconnected documentation approach eliminates redundancy while maintaining comprehensive analysis.

# Visualization Guidelines for Marketing Analysis

When documenting marketing analysis findings, use these visualization approaches to communicate complex interconnections:

## Findings Relationship Map Requirements

Each root cause analysis should include a visual representation that maps symptoms to causes. Acceptable formats include:

1. **Network Diagram:**  
     
   * Root causes as central nodes  
   * Dimension manifestations as secondary nodes  
   * Lines/arrows showing relationships between nodes  
   * Color coding to indicate severity

   

2. **Impact Matrix:**  
     
   * Root causes as rows  
   * Dimensions as columns  
   * Severity indicators in intersection cells (Critical, High, Medium, Low)  
   * Color-coding for visual clarity

   

3. **Hierarchical Flow Chart:**  
     
   * Root causes at the top level  
   * Dimension manifestations as branches  
   * Specific symptoms as leaf nodes  
   * Directional arrows showing causality

## Severity Visualization Standards

Use consistent visual indicators for severity levels:

* **Critical:** Red (#E53935) - Requires immediate attention  
* **High:** Orange (#FB8C00) - Significant business impact  
* **Medium:** Yellow (#FFD600) - Notable but not urgent  
* **Low:** Green (#43A047) - Minimal business impact

## Relationship Type Indicators

Use these visual indicators for different types of relationships:

* **Causal:** Solid arrows (➡️) - Direct cause-effect relationship  
* **Dependency:** Chain link symbol (⛓️) - Cannot fix one until the other is addressed  
* **Bidirectional:** Circular arrows (🔄) - Mutually reinforcing issues

## Implementation Priority Matrix Visualization

The 2x2 priority matrix should use:

* Consistent color-coding based on priority quadrant  
* Clear quadrant labels (Quick Wins, Strategic Initiatives, Minor Fixes, Avoid)  
* Icons to indicate estimated timeline or resource requirements  
* Brief item descriptions that reference specific findings
