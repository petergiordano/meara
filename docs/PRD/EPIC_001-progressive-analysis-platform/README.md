# EPIC-001: Progressive Website Analysis Platform

> Transform DeepStack Collector into a complete end-to-end marketing analysis platform that delivers comprehensive reports in a single, delightful user experience.

**Status:** 🟡 Planning

## Quick Navigation

- [Product Requirements (PRD)](./PRD_progressive-analysis-platform.md)
- [Design Specification](./DESIGN_SPEC_progressive-analysis-platform.md)
- [Functional Specification](./FUNCTIONAL_SPEC_progressive-analysis-platform.md)
- [Technical Specification](./TECHNICAL_SPEC_progressive-analysis-platform.md)
- [Sprint Planning](./SPRINTS.md)

## Overview

Currently, the MEARA system has two disconnected experiences:
1. **DeepStack Collector web app** - Analyzes a website, returns raw JSON (2-3 minutes)
2. **OpenAI Assistants backend** - Runs 7 AI agents to generate full report (6-8 minutes)

Users must manually download the DeepStack JSON and figure out how to run the full analysis. This epic unifies these into a single, progressive web experience where users enter a company URL once and receive a complete marketing effectiveness analysis report 8-10 minutes later - all within the same interface.

### The Problem

Marketing consultants using MEARA face a fragmented workflow:
- Start analysis on web interface
- Download intermediate JSON file
- Manually invoke Python scripts with command line
- Wait for multiple AI agents to complete
- Receive final report via file system

This creates friction, requires technical knowledge, and prevents non-technical users from accessing MEARA's powerful analysis capabilities.

### The Solution

A single-page progressive web application that:
1. Accepts company name + URL + optional context documents
2. Runs DeepStack Collector (shows progress: 0-100%)
3. Offers choice: "Download results" or "Continue to full analysis"
4. If user continues: runs 7 OpenAI Assistants with multi-stage progress
5. Displays beautiful, formatted report with download options

All in one sitting, one browser tab, no technical knowledge required.
